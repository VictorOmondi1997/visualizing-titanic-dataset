# Visualizing titanic dataset

# Introduction to the dataset
We'll be working with a data set of the passengers of the Titanic. The [Titanic shipwreck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinking_of_the_RMS_Titanic) is the most famous shipwreck in history and led to the creation of better safety regulations for ships. One substantial safety issue was that there were not enough lifeboats for every passenger on board, which meant that some passengers were prioritized over others to use the lifeboats.

The data set was compiled by Kaggle for their introductory data science competition, called Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster. The goal of the competition is to build machine learning models that can predict if a passenger survives from their attributes. You can download the data set by navigating to the [data download page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) for the competition and creating a free account.
